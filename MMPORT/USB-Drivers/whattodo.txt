Please note that replacing USBD.SYS *MAY* crash your system OR get yourself
an instable OS. Before replacing make sure that you made backups of all your
data, just to be sure. You should also be able to boot OS/2 / eComStation from
a bootable floppy or cd-rom, just in case you need to reinstate that driver.

Check, if MMPORT / Casio WMP-1 is already working with your CURRENT drivers
(if they are dated later than january 2003), BEFORE even thinking about trying
my USBD.SYS. I warned you!

Please note as well that USBCALLS.DLL also shot down my system more than once
(not my own driver, but you never know, I just fixed one bug!), so make sure
that you first check to use the latest file (if you got one dated later than
january 2003), BEFORE even thinking about trying my USBCALLS.DLL. I warned you!

Using my USB4REXX.DLL won't hurt your system and that file is really needed.

USBD.SYS belongs into \OS2\BOOT
USBCALLS.DLL belongs into \OS2\DLL
and my own USB4REXX.DLL belongs into \OS2\DLL
