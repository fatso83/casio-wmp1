Okay, so here you have it. It's not worked out fully, but it's easy to do
USB communications with (at least the ones I needed on the Casio WMP-1 watch).
Everything else wasn't done (special transfer modes), but those didn't work
anyway, because of further bugs in USBCALLS and/or USBD.

Have fun playing with the source. Anyway, you need GLOBREXX.OBJ and GLOBSTR.OBJ
Both are in the JimiHelp subdirectory. I don't release sources to those, anyway
they "just" include some string helpers and the other one contains Rexx helper
functions, that I use in various projects.

All personal header files are in JimiHelp as well, but note that USBCALLS.h got
modified from USBCALLS package (bug again) and USBTYPE.h is official from IBM.
I use some personal C defines (ffs global.h, etc.) and w/o them, my code won't
 work.
