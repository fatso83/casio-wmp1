Compiling and installing wmp_manager in 2013 (and beyond)
----------------------------------------------------------
What you need:
  - A C++ compiler (like GCC)
  - make
  - libusb-0.1 (see below)

The first two comes with most Linux distros, and if you are running Mac,
then you can easily get hold of them by installing the package "Command
Line Tools", available from <a
href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=Command%20Line%20Tools%20%28OS%20X%20Mountain%20Lion%29">the Developer pages at Apple</a>.

This program was made using a library called libusb. Unfortunately the
version it was made with, 0.1, is now deprecated and no longer
compatible with the newer libusb. There is a compatibility layer for
programs using the old version called libusb-compat, but it would not
let me upload files. 
Thankfully, the old version is still available for download! You can get
it <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-0.1%20%28LEGACY%29/0.1.12/">here</a>.
Unpack it, make, and make install. That's it.

To get the library to compile with modern compilers, you need to disable the
warnings. This is very easy; just open the file called Makefile, and add
a hash ("#") at the start of the line that says AM_CFLAGS = -Werror
$(AM_CFLAGS_EXT). 

Now that the prerequisites are in place, all you need to compile the
program is to issue <code>make</code>, and you are done.
