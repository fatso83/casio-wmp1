*Software for file management on the classic Casio WMP-1 watch*

This source code enables you to use the classic Casio WMP-1 wrist watch
on Linux. The software might also work on Windows platform, as its only
dependency is on libusb, which has been ported to Windows. This has not
been tested.

For a bit of history and usage, see the old <a

* Additional info *
I have kept an old copy of the original software for Windows 98 <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/514315/casio_wmp1/casio_wap.zip">Casio WAP.</a> Still worked in Windows XP the last time I tried it (using Win98 emulation mode). Do not know about Windows 7 though ... But if you are on the lookout, then this is your lucky day :)

I also have a copy of the original contents of the MMC (including firmware) in case you should somehow manage to fuck it up. Can be found <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/514315/casio_wmp1/wmp1_org_firmware.dat">here</a>.
