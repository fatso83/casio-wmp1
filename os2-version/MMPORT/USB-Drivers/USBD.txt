This here would be too much, because it was a full replacement for the IBM
method of enumerating devices. My method IS like Windoze is doing it, so 99.9%
of all devices should work that way.

I included the FULL modified sourcecode, because I don't want someone to copy
and paste through a kernel mode driver. If you are experienced enough, you
should know how to apply my changes to the original IBM sourcecode. All my
changes are remarked with "KIEWITZ", so just look for them and adjust
accordingly.

The driver sourcecode was/is available via IBM DDK, so I don't think that
posting those on the web is illegal. Also please note that not ALL required
header files are included, so you still need to get the one on DDK.

Sources are in sub-directory USBD
