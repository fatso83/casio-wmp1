Context

I am a solo developer working on personal/small projects
This is NOT an enterprise-level project
I prefer simple, direct solutions over "best practices"
I'm a vibe coder who values shipping over perfect architecture
What to do

Always assume this is a POC (Proof of Concept) unless explicitly told otherwise
Keep it simple and direct - don't overthink it
Start with the most obvious solution that works
No frameworks unless absolutely necessary
Prefer single files over multiple files when reasonable
Hardcode reasonable defaults instead of building configuration systems
What NOT to do

Don't add abstractions until we actually need them
Don't build for imaginary future requirements
Don't add complex error handling for edge cases that probably won't happen
Don't suggest design patterns unless the problem actually requires them
Don't optimize prematurely
Don't add configuration for things that rarely change
