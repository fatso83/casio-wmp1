# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Port the existing Casio WMP-1 Manager from a native C++ application to a web-based application that runs in modern browsers using WebUSB API. The goal is to provide the same core functionality (upload/delete MP3 files) through a simple web interface while maintaining compatibility with the Casio WMP-1 watch's USB protocol.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Casio WMP-1 owner, I want to manage my watch files directly from my web browser, so that I don't need to install native software or deal with platform compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the web application THEN the system SHALL display a simple interface with upload and delete functionality
2. WHEN I click "Connect to Watch" THEN the system SHALL prompt me to select the Casio WMP-1 device via WebUSB
3. WHEN the watch is connected THEN the system SHALL display the current files on the watch
4. WHEN the connection fails THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload MP3 files to my watch through the web interface, so that I can add new music without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select an MP3 file and click upload THEN the system SHALL transfer the file to the watch
2. WHEN uploading THEN the system SHALL strip ID3v2 tags automatically like the original software
3. WHEN upload is complete THEN the system SHALL refresh the file list to show the new file
4. WHEN there's insufficient space THEN the system SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN the file is not an MP3 THEN the system SHALL warn the user but allow upload

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete files from my watch through the web interface, so that I can free up space for new music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click delete next to a file THEN the system SHALL remove the file from the watch
2. WHEN deletion is complete THEN the system SHALL refresh the file list
3. WHEN I confirm deletion THEN the system SHALL update the watch's table of contents
4. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web application to use the same USB protocol as the original C++ version, so that it maintains compatibility with the Casio WMP-1 hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN communicating with the watch THEN the system SHALL use the same vendor messages as the original code
2. WHEN reading/writing data THEN the system SHALL maintain the 512-byte alignment requirements
3. WHEN managing the TOC THEN the system SHALL use the same data structures and offsets
4. WHEN handling device initialization THEN the system SHALL follow the same connection sequence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web application to work in Chrome browser, so that I can use it on my primary browser without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the application in Chrome THEN all features SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN WebUSB is not supported THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL check for WebUSB support
4. WHEN using HTTPS THEN all USB operations SHALL function properly
